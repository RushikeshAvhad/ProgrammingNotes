Question - Explain DotNet Versions

.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that primarily runs on Windows.
It provides a large library of pre-coded solutions to common programming problems and a runtime environment for executing applications. 
.NET has evolved over the years, with each version bringing new features, improvements, and updates.

Here's a brief overview of the different versions of .NET:

.NET Framework:
    The first version of .NET, released in 2002.
    It's a software development platform for building and running Windows applications.
    Initially focused on desktop applications and later expanded to web and server applications.
    Versions up to 4.8 were released, with each version introducing new features and improvements.

.NET Core:
    Announced in 2014, .NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework designed for developing modern, high-performance applications.
    It can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    .NET Core was built from scratch, offering better performance, scalability, and flexibility compared to the .NET Framework.
    It also introduced support for containerized applications.
    The versioning of .NET Core started from 1.0 and continued to 2.1, 2.2, and 3.0, with 3.1 being a long-term support (LTS) release.
    .NET Core 3.x is the last release under the name ".NET Core."

.NET 5:
    Announced in 2019, .NET 5 is the successor to both .NET Core and .NET Framework.
    It unifies the .NET platform, merging .NET Core and Mono (an open-source implementation of .NET) into a single framework.
    .NET 5 supports a wider range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and more.
    It's not just cross-platform, but also cross-application type, meaning it can be used for desktop, web, cloud, mobile, and IoT applications.
    .NET 5 is not an LTS release; instead, it's part of the new release cadence where new versions are released every year.

.NET 6 and beyond:
    .NET 6 was released in November 2021 and is another major release in the new .NET unification effort.
    It continues the journey of making .NET more versatile, performant, and developer-friendly.
    .NET 6 is an LTS (Long-Term Support) release, with support for three years.
    Subsequent versions will continue this yearly release cadence, with new features, improvements, and support for more platforms and scenarios.

Each version of .NET brings improvements in performance, features, and platform support, aiming to make .NET a competitive and versatile framework for modern software development.
