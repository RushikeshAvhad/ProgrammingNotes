        Limited support for some Windows-specific technologies.

.NET 5:
    Initial Release: 2020
    Key Features:
        Unified Platform:
            Merged .NET Core and Mono to create a single, unified platform.

        Not LTS: 
            Unlike .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5 is not a Long-Term Support release; it's part of the new yearly release cycle.
    Usage: 
        Like .NET Core, it's used for a wide range of applications, from web to desktop, cloud, mobile, and IoT.
    Limitations: 
        Still, some Windows-specific features may not be fully supported.

    Key Features:
        LTS Release: 
            .NET 6 is an LTS release, offering three years of support.
        Continued Unification: 
            Continues the unification efforts started with .NET 5.
        Performance Enhancements:  
            Further improvements in performance and efficiency.
        New APIs and Features: 
            Introduces new APIs and features to enhance developer productivity.
        More Platforms: 
            Expands support to additional platforms and scenarios.
    Usage: 
        Recommended for applications requiring long-term support and stability. 
        Suitable for a wide range of application types.
    Limitations: 
        Despite improvements, some legacy Windows-specific features may still not be fully supported.

.NET 7
    .NET 7 is the successor to .NET 6 and focuses on being unified, modern, simple, and fast. 
    .NET 7 will be supported for 18 months as a standard-term support (STS) release (previously known as a current release).
    Performance
        Performance is a key focus of .NET 7, and all of its features are designed with performance in mind. 
    
    In addition, .NET 7 includes the following enhancements aimed purely at performance:
        On-stack replacement (OSR) is a complement to tiered compilation.
        It allows the runtime to change the code executed by a currently running method in the middle of its execution 
        (that is, while it's "on stack"). 
        Long-running methods can switch to more optimized versions mid-execution.
        Profile-guided optimization (PGO) now works with OSR and is easier to enable (by adding <TieredPGO>true</TieredPGO> to your project file).
        PGO can also instrument and optimize additional things, such as delegates.
        Improved code generation for Arm64.
        Native AOT produces a standalone executable in the target platform's file format with no external dependencies.
        It's entirely native, with no IL or JIT, and provides fast startup time and a small, self-contained deployment. 
        In .NET 7, Native AOT focuses on console apps and requires apps to be trimmed.
        Performance improvements to the Mono runtime, which powers Blazor WebAssembly, Android, and iOS apps.
    

Each version of .NET builds upon the previous ones, addressing limitations, adding new features, and expanding platform support, 
making it more versatile and suitable for modern application development.
